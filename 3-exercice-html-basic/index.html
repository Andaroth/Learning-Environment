                    <strong>Greenpeace investigates</strong>, campaigns, documents and lobbies for a sustainable balance between humans and the environment worldwide. And if this doesnâ€™t help, *we expose* environmental abuses by carrying out non-violent direct actions.

                    It's a <strong>positive vision</strong>, rooted in *hope*, and the conviction that when people in large numbers believe change is possible, change becomes possible. We believe that when we take Nature as our model, mentor, and measure, we can change the way we feed and fuel our world. We can live in harmony with the Earth and <strong>each other</strong>.

                    Our climate is the <strong>engine for life</strong> support systems that sustain and nurture us all. Climate and weather drive the ebb and flow of life, making rivers run, crops grow, and forests flourish. But now this vital foundation of life has been pushed off balance.
